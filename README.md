### Projects
<!-- 
- **HFT-X – High-Frequency Trading Simulator:**  
  Built a real-time C++ trading engine with multithreaded order flows, Monte Carlo pricing, and Bayesian strategy switching.

- **Neural Diffusion Inversion:**  
  Trained deep models to reverse-engineer initial states from final outcomes of PDEs. U-Net + PyTorch magic.
-->
- **Blockchain Data Traceability:**  
  Built a data NFT system using Ethereum, IPFS, and a watermark-chain verification scheme.

- **Infinite Precision CLI Calculator:**  
  High-performance BigInt/BigFloat engine with Karatsuba and FFT support.

- **ARPie (Packet Sniffer/Simulator):**  
  Built using Pcap++ for real-time analysis and spoof testing.

- **MiniML Interpreter (Extended):**  
  Added division and exception handling to a custom functional language.
